## Usage
In attempting to get this application working in the university's virtual environment, I learned that you must import
the project using the pom.xml in the root directory. You must also be sure to select the Maven runtime bundled with
the IntelliJ IDE is the build settings editor for the program to run properly from that environment.

## JavaDoc Directory
### /index-files

## Additional Report
The third report to be designed and implemented by the student in this application is a Log File Viewer Report that
implements a ComboBox in the user interface to select which of the application log files to view.

The application has four options as follows:
1. Login Activity
2. Application Non-Exception Events
3. Exception Events
4. Database Access Attempt Events
The application has functionality to populate these log files throughout the application as related events occur.
